# Using Scientific Software engineering to implement the transcendental function $y=ab^{x}$.

Software engineering best practices such as agile methodologies and DevOps are increasingly incorporated in the development and implementations of software in organisations. In scientific software engineering, for instance, scientific calculators have to support functionalities including evaluating transcendental functions. In this document we present an implementation of the function $ab^x$. 


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your 
local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
*  The project can be run from eclipse or
*  Directly from the JAR app.
*  The document can also be view from Latex file or PDF format
