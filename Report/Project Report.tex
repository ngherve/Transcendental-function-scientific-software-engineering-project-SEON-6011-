\section{Introduction} \label{s:intro}
A paper starts off with the section introducing the research problem and explaining the background and motivation.

\section{Section heading 2} \label{s:sec2}
The review of literature can be a separate section but it can be merged with the introduction section. One can find a number of reference examples at the end of this template, like,

\section{Section heading 3} \label{s:methods}
First-level headings should be in bold.

\subsection{
\emph{Subsection heading 3.1}} \label{s:methods.1}
Second-level headings should be in bold italics.

\subsubsection{\emph{Sub-subsection heading 3.1.1}} \label{s:methods.1.1}

Third-level headings should be in italics.
	
\subsection{\emph{Subsection heading 3.2}} \label{s:methods.2}


\subsection{\emph{Subsection heading 3.3}} \label{s:methods.3}
	
\section{Section heading 4} \label{s:numerical}
Perhaps numerical analysis of performance, comparison, and demonstration of applicability and impact using real data.

\section{Conclusion}\label{s:conclusion}
A paper ends with a conclusion or summary section.
